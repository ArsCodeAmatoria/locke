# zkID Login

A decentralized identity verification system built on Polkadot and Substrate with Zero-Knowledge Proofs for privacy-preserving authentication.

## Features

- **Polkadot Wallet Authentication**: Connect using Polkadot.js browser extension
- **Mobile Wallet Support**: Connect using WalletConnect, Nova Wallet, and other mobile wallets
- **Decentralized Identity (DID)**: Store your identity on the Substrate blockchain
- **Soul-Bound Tokens (SBTs)**: Non-transferable credentials issued to your identity
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Verify credential ownership without revealing sensitive data
- **WASM-powered**: ZK proofs generated in the browser with WebAssembly
- **Cyberpunk-inspired UI**: Modern interface with neon aesthetics
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for desktop and mobile devices

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 (App Router), Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, Lucide icons, Framer Motion
- **Web3 Integration**: Polkadot/js API, Extension-dapp, WalletConnect
- **ZK Proofs**: WASM-compiled Rust using bellman, bls12_381 for cryptographic operations
- **Blockchain**: Substrate pallets for DID and SBT with custom runtime

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ installed
- Polkadot.js browser extension installed (for desktop)
- Nova Wallet, Talisman, or another Polkadot mobile wallet (for mobile users)
- For full functionality: Substrate node running with custom pallets (for demo purposes, mock APIs are provided)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/zkid-login.git
cd zkid-login
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

### Running a Local Substrate Node (Optional)

For full functionality, you can run a local Substrate node with our custom pallets:

```bash
# Start the node in development mode
./start-substrate-node.sh
```

## Project Structure

    - `src/components/MobileWalletConnect.tsx`: Mobile wallet connection component
  - `src/lib/`: Utility libraries and hooks
    - `src/lib/hooks/use-auth.tsx`: Authentication hook for managing login state
    - `src/lib/substrate-client.ts`: Client for interacting with Substrate node
    - `src/lib/wasm-zkp/`: WASM module for ZK proof generation/verification
    - `src/lib/walletconnect-utils.ts`: Utilities for mobile wallet connections

- **Blockchain**:
  - `substrate/pallet-did/`: Substrate pallet for Decentralized Identity
  - `substrate/pallet-sbt/`: Substrate pallet for Soul-Bound Tokens
  - `substrate/runtime/`: Substrate runtime configuration

## Mobile Wallet Support

The zkID Login system now supports mobile wallets for authentication:

### Supported Mobile Wallets

- **WalletConnect**: Connect using QR code scanning from any WalletConnect-compatible wallet
- **Nova Wallet**: Polkadot & Kusama ecosystem mobile wallet
- **Talisman**: Cross-chain wallet with Polkadot support
- **SubWallet**: Polkadot ecosystem wallet
- **Polkadot.js Mobile**: Official Polkadot mobile wallet

### Mobile Authentication Flow

1. User selects "USE MOBILE WALLET" on the authentication screen
2. User chooses their preferred wallet from the available options
3. For WalletConnect: A QR code is displayed for the user to scan with their mobile wallet
4. For direct mobile wallets: A deep link is generated to open the wallet app (when on mobile)
5. The wallet connects and provides account information to the application
6. The authentication proceeds with DID verification and credential checking

### Implementation Details

- Automatic device detection to provide optimized UI for mobile users
- QR code generation for WalletConnect using the Google Charts API
- Deep linking support for direct wallet app opening
- Responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes
- Session management for persistent connections

## Substrate Integration Details

### DID Pallet

The DID (Decentralized Identifier) pallet provides:

- Registration of on-chain DIDs linked to account addresses
- DID management and updating
- Storage of DID documents with controller information
- Secure validation of DID ownership

### SBT Pallet

The SBT (Soul-Bound Token) pallet provides:

- Issuance of non-transferable credentials as Soul-Bound Tokens
- Credential metadata storage and management
- Verification of credential validity
- Revocation capability for credential issuers

### Runtime Integration

The Substrate runtime combines the DID and SBT pallets to create a complete identity management system:

- Authentication through account signatures
- Authorization based on DID ownership
- Credential verification using the integrated pallets
- Zero-knowledge proof verification for privacy-preserving authentication

## Zero-Knowledge Proof System

Our ZK proof system allows users to:

1. Generate proofs in the browser using WebAssembly
2. Prove attributes about their credentials without revealing the actual data
3. Verify proofs on-chain through the Substrate node

Example use cases:

- Age verification (prove you're over 18 without revealing your actual age)
- Income verification (prove you earn above a threshold without revealing exact income)
- Citizenship verification (prove country of citizenship without revealing personal details)

## Login Flow

1. User connects their wallet (desktop extension or mobile wallet)
2. The system retrieves the user's DID and SBTs from the Substrate blockchain
3. If a user doesn't have a DID, they can create one
4. When verification is needed, a ZK proof is generated in the browser using WASM
5. The proof is verified on-chain, proving credential ownership without revealing data
6. Upon successful verification, the user is authenticated
